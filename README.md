## SherlockHolmsNetworks.ipynb
In the four novels A Study In Scarlet, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear, and The Sign of the Four by author Arthur Conan Doyle, private detective Sherlock Holmes is a recurring main character who tackles investigative cases for a wide range of clients. In this individual project I use text and network analysis methods to understand how character and location relationships in each novel are captured using these methods. In particular, sentential co-occurrence of character, location, and event entities is the focus of this project.

## neural_networks_project.ipynb
This is a group project with team members J. Chen, F. Mota, and T. Phu. In this notebook we use TensorFlow to compare the performance of varying neural network typologies and hyperparameter settings in image recognition using the MNIST data set. using Aurélien Géron's chapter 11 notebook for guidance--https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/11_deep_learning.ipynb.

#### Required packages
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- graphviz
- pydot
- time
- functools
- random

#### Input files
MNIST dataset - installed through API in notebook

#### Outputs
28 pdf images - see outputs in neural_networks_image_outputs.zip folder
